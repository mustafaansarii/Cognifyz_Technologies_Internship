# Restaurant Ratings and Analysis

Welcome to the Restaurant Ratings and Analysis project by Cognifyz, where we explore various aspects of restaurant data to gain insights into the culinary world.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings, determine the most common rating range, and calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants. Additionally, we will delve into cuisine combinations, assess whether certain combinations tend to have higher ratings, perform geographic analysis by plotting restaurant locations on a map, and identify any patterns or clusters in specific areas. Finally, we will examine restaurant chains present in the dataset, analyzing their ratings and popularity.
