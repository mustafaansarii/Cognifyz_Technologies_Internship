# Restaurant Reviews and Analysis

Welcome to the Restaurant Reviews and Analysis project by Cognifyz, where we delve into the world of restaurant reviews to gain valuable insights. In this project, we will analyze text reviews to identify common positive and negative keywords, calculate the average length of reviews, and explore if there's a relationship between review length and rating. We'll also delve into votes analysis, identifying restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes and exploring the correlation between votes and restaurant ratings. Additionally, we'll investigate the relationship between price range and the availability of online delivery and table booking.
